# Comics Explorer & Recommendation System

## Overview
This project is a **desktop application for comic book enthusiasts**, developed as part of an academic software engineering course.  
It allows users to **search, explore, manage, and receive recommendations for comics and characters**, inspired by platforms such as Comic Vine.

The application provides both **guest and authenticated modes**. Logged-in users can manage personal collections, track reading progress, and receive personalized recommendations based on their preferences and activity.

## Database

The application uses a **local SQLite database** to store user-related data, including:
- User accounts
- Favorite comics
- Purchase lists
- Personal libraries
- Reading progress status

This local database approach allows the application to run fully offline without requiring any external server or cloud infrastructure.

A database schema diagram is available in:
- `images/BddDiagram.jpg`

## Class Diagram

A UML class diagram illustrating the overall architecture and relationships between the main components is available in:
- `images/ClassDiagram.jpg`

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure that the following requirement is met.

### Java 21

This project requires **Java 21**.

Java can be downloaded from:
- https://jdk.java.net/21/
- https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk21-archive-downloads.html

Verify the installation with:
```bash
java -version

## Dependencies

All dependencies are managed using **Maven** to ensure consistency and ease of build across different environments.

The main libraries used in this project are:
- **JSON Simple (1.1.1)** – Used for parsing and handling JSON data returned by the API
- **OkHttp (4.9.3)** – HTTP client used to communicate with the Comic Vine API
- **SQLite JDBC (3.42.0.0)** – JDBC driver for the local SQLite database
- **MySQL Connector (8.0.33)** – JDBC connector (optional usage)

All dependencies and their versions are defined in the `pom.xml` file.

## Installation

Follow the steps below to install and run the application locally.

### Step 1: Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/comics-explorer-java.git
cd comics-explorer-java

### Step 2: Build the project

Use Maven to compile the project and download all required dependencies.

```bash
mvn clean install
```

This command will:
- Compile the source code
